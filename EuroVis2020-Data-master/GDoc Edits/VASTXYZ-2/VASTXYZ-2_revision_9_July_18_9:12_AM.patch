+ABILA, Kronos - In a touching ceremony Wednesday leaders of the activist 
+group Protectors of Kronos paid tribute to their fallen leader, Elian Karel, 
+who was murdered on 19 June 2009 while being illegally detained in a 
+Kronos jail.'Today we gather to remember Elian Karel,' Silvia Marek told the 
+rapt assembly, many of whom held up white candles in Karel's honor.'Elian 
+was born on an Elodis farm not 40 minutes from here, to Jeroen and 
+Antaura Karel. He grew up with the specter of death all around him. By the 
+time Elian was 17 many of his family members and friends were battling 
+constant illness, including his neighbor 10-year old Juliana Vann.'Marek paused a moment to allow the cries of 'Remember Juliana!' to fade.'Elian 
+devoted his life to the people of Elodis as well as all citizens of Kronos, as 
+did his father before him. Elian knew his would be a difficult journey. He had 
+watched his father, Jeroen and the founder of the POK, Henk Bodrogi walk 
+the very path he would tread. Elian knew the course would not be easy, and 
+would leave little time for a personal life. Yet he chose to take those steps 
+despite the challenges he knew he would face.''Elian's journey ended three 
+years ago today. But his dream did not die with him. And it is that vision of 
+a healthy and prosperous future for all we are here today to honor.'Over the 
+course of the afternoon several other speakers paid tribute to not only 
+Elian, but all who have been victims of the environmental catastrophe 
+brought about by greed and corruption of public officials. The gathering 
+was marred only by the aggravating presence of Abila police in riot gear. 
+The police agitated many of the crowd, causing them to have to leave the 
+assembly rather than be assailed with batons and pepper spray.
