+whether or not the fire alarm was intentionally pulled. 
+ 2021 UPDATE - A Kronos Government official who asked not to be identified 
+but was present at the government reception has gone on the record  stating, 'Investigators are working around the clock to ensure that the 
+kidnapped GAStech employees are found and that the perpetrators are 
+brought to justice.'This is the first confirmation that today's events 
+surrounding GAStech - Kronos are in fact a kidnapping. With fourteen 
+individuals still unaccounted for, at this point, the assumption is that all are 
+the victims of a kidnapping. No group has come forward yet to claim 
+responsibility nor have any demands been made. 
+ 1245 UPDATE - Abila Police have cordoned off the GAStech headquarters 
+with additional officers arriving to secure the perimeter and to investigate 
+what can only be described as a crime scene though the crime has not be 
+revealed. The police response seems out of proportion for a false fire 
+alarm. Police officials have declined to comment at this time.
