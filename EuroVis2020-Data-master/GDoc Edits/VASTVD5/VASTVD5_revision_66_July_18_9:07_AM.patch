+ 934 UPDATE - Abila Police indicated that they are working with law 
+enforcement and government officials from Tethys. The number of the 
+missing has been revised from fourteen to ten. The names of the missing - 
+and presumably kidnapped - have yet to be released. Police stated that 
+given the evolving nature of the incident announcing the names of the 
+missing employees would simply add to the confusion, speculation, and 
+potentially hinder the ongoing investigation. A GAStech International news 
+conference has been announced for 10:00 this morning Kronos time.
