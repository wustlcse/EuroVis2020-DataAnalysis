  What happened on 20-21 2014?

 -Was reported that 14 GAStech employees were missing, later revised 
 to 10 when the company leaders were found, safe.  
 -POK claimed responsibility and demanded $20 mil in ransom 
-      Rabadams - brexit, anti corporations 
+ Theory: The security team seems to have a lack of vetting, several 
+members either have direct ties or strong implications that they are tied to 
+leadership/key people in the POK. Several of the Kronos born members of 
+the security team served in the Kronos military and received less than 
+honorable discharged, multiple having started to work for GAStech just a 
+few months prior to the kidnapping. I believe that Isia Vann (older brother to 
+Juliana Vann) has been planning this event for several years, using his 
+connections within the GAStech organization to build a security team to 
+enable this “kidnapping.”  
+ Next Steps: First, we need to find out who actually was kidnapped/is still 
+missing. Next, we need to interview the entire security team to find out how 
+this happened. We need to keep the names listed above separate from 
+each other and cross reference their answers.
