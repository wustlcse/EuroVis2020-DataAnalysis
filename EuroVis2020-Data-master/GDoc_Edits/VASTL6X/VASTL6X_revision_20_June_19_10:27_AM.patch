+UNFETTERED KLEPTOCRACY THAT HAS BECOME OUR GOVERNMENT AND TO THE 
+IMPERIALIST ACTIVITIES OF THE FOREIGN CORPORATIONS ON OUR HOMELAND. WE 
+HAVE TAKEN STEPS TO ENSURE OUR VOICE - YOUR VOICES - ARE HEARD WITHOUT 
+SUPPRESSION OR DISTORTION. THE INACTIONS AND IGNORANCE OF OUR ELECTED 
+OFFICIALS HAVE FORCED US INTO THESE MEASURES. YESTERDAY, WE THWARTED A 
+CELEBRATION OF GREED AND CORRUPTION BETWEEN FOREIGN BUSINESSMEN WHO, 
+IN COLLUSION WITH OUR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS, WORKED TO IMPOVERISH 99% OF 
+THIS GREAT NATION TO THEIR OWN BENEFIT. IN AN ACT OF DEFIANCE WE 
+APPREHENDED THE ELITISTS WHO HAVE EXPLOITED OUR RESOURCES, KILLED OUR 
+CHILDREN AND RUINED OUR WAY OF LIFE. WE ARE DEMANDING RECOMPENSE IN THE 
+FORM OF $20 MILLION WHICH WILL BE USED TO ALLEVIATE THE SUFFERING OF THE 
+PEOPLE. THIS IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARD TAKING OUR COUNTRY BACK. 21 Jan 2014
