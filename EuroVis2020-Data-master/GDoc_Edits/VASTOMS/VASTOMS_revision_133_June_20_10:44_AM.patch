  Breaking: Emergency at GAStech Headquarters Building [Updates] Cato Rossini, Marcella Trapani
  Kronos Star | 01/20/2014
  Update 1:00 PM: Police have come and gone from the GAStech building, but up to this point no GAStech employees have left the building. We still have no official word on why the police are present.
+ Update, 1:35 PM: We called the office of Ingrid Barranco, the GSAtech Chief Financial Officer. Her administrator, who was very uneasy during the conversation, informed us that Ms. Barranco is unavailable for comment.
  Update, 2:00 PM: A government car was allowed through the police perimeter. The occupant, who appears to be a security official, was let into the building.
  Update, 3:05 PM: Some police have left the scene, but others remain to outside to secure the building while others are still in the building. There is much speculation about their activities, but police have yet to respond to our queries for information.
  Update, 3:20 PM: GAStech employees are being allowed to leave the building.
